This inspection reports all instances of "magic numbers", literal numeric constants used without declaration,
                used in JavaScript code.
"Magic numbers" can result in code whose intention is extremely unclear, and may result in errors if a "magic
number" is changed in one code location but not another.  The numbers 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 0L, 1L,
0.0, 1.0, 0.0F and 1.0F are not reported by this inspection.
