                This inspection reports any instances of JavaScript comma expressions.  Comma
                expressions are often a sign of overly clever code, and may lead to subtle bugs.
                Comma expressions in the initializer or update section of a <b><font color="#000080">for</font></b>
                loop are ignored by this inspection.
