                This inspection reports any instances of overly long JavaScript functions.
                Function length is calculated by counting up the number of non-empty statements in the function.
                Functions that are too long are error-prone, and difficult to test.
                <p>
                    Use the field provided below to specify the maximum acceptable number of statements a function
                    might have.
