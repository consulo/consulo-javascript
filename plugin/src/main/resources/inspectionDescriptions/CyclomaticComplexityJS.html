                This inspection reports any instances of JavaScript functions that have too high a cyclomatic complexity.
                Cyclomatic complexity is basically a measurement of the number of branching points in a function. Functions
                with too high a cyclomatic complexity may be confusing and difficult to test.
                <p>
                    Use the field provided below to specify the maximum acceptable cyclomatic complexity a function
                    might have.
