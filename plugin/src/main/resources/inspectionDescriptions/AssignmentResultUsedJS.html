                This inspection reports assignment expressions where the result of the assignment is
                used in a containing expression. Such assignments are often indications of coding errors
                such as using <b><font color="#000080">=</font></b> instead of <b><font color="#000080">==</font></b>.
                Morever, they can result in confusion due to order
                of operations, as evaluation of the assignment may effect the outer expression in unexpected
                ways.
